'''
Take a list, say for example this one:
a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list
that are less than 5.

Extras:
1    Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has 
     all the elements less than 5 from this list in it 
     and print out this new list.
     
2    Write this in one line of Python.

3    Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only 
     elements from the original list a that are smaller than 
     that number given by the user.
